# smart-contract

## Overview

In this challenge, we focus on structs within smart contracts. Below are the steps to complete the challenge:

1. Deploy a new contract containing a struct of your choice.
2. Create a dictionary or array to store instances of the struct.
3. Implement a function to add new instances of the struct to the dictionary or array.
4. Add a transaction to invoke the function created in step 3.
5. Develop a script to read and display the struct's data.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Contract Deployment

Deploy a new smart contract that includes a struct. The struct should represent a meaningful entity within your project.

### 2. Data Storage

Create either a dictionary or an array within the contract to store instances of the struct.

### 3. Functionality Addition

Implement a function within the contract to add new instances of the struct to the dictionary or array.

### 4. Transaction Invocation

Add a transaction to the contract to call the function created in step 3. This transaction will be responsible for adding new instances of the struct to the storage.

### 5. Script Development

Develop a script to interact with the deployed contract and read the stored struct data. This script should retrieve and display the data stored in the struct instances.
